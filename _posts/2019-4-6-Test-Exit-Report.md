title: Shall we Transform or Exit out of "Test Exit Report" ?
---
The story started after I've made my three wishes too ealier before I find the Aladdin's magic lamp.

I have been asking myself the same question from time to time since I started in testing.

**What's the future look like for me as a tester?**


*My earlier testing life*
I thought I had the answer in my very earlier testing life, after I started get involved in a project as an SMEs from the business. I was inspired and motivated by contractor testing professionals I worked with over a few projects. I admired their methodology approach and technical skills. I admired them finding critical bugs and I started volunteering for SMEs related testing activities. I was learning to hunt down bugs because at the time I believe it is what a good tester do. I was determined that I want to be a good tester. Then, I received advices about the ISTQB foundation as a minimum requirement for a tester in many organisations. I went on an ISTQB training and got certified a few months later. The future for me as a tester was clear - a bug hunter hero everyone loves. A good tester who write a lot of beautiful step by step test cases for the future testers to use to find bugs in the systems.

My three wishes into the future;
1. Testers facilitate, coach, influence others for better quality incorporate quality mindset into every corner of SDLC
2. No more useless, meaningless and wasteful testing artifacts
3. No more divide within testing (automated vs manual) it's bad!
