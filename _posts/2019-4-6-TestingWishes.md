My three wishes into the future from 2019:
1. Testers facilitate, coach, influence others for better quality, incorporate quality mindset into every corner of SDLC. ***it's the thinking that matters!***
2. No more useless, meaningless and wasteful testing artefacts and documentations. ***it's a waste.***
3. No more divide within testing (automated vs manual; technical vs non-technical). ***it's bad!***



[The story started after I've made my three wishes too early before I find Aladdin's magic lamp.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/aladdins-magic-lamp-luke-liu)
