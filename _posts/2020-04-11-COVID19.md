#Numbers don't lie but ...

During #COVID19, people are following the news, social media, unknown rumours, fake news to form a picture of the current situation every day. Data and information came to us in all different formats. Some are helpful and relevant while others consume our time but provide little value to us in terms of forming a relatively accurate picture of the current situation.

As a #tester, I have been thinking about what I could learn from this experience and apply it to #testing in the last few weeks. Here is my learning I would like to share with anyone who's interested why "numbers don't lie but they may not tell you the full story".
